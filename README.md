# Remaking Risetku.com with Next.js, Typescript and Sass

I changed the tech stack to Next.js because of its Server-Side Rendering Feature, SSO compatible, and Automatic Routing. Also used Typescript because in the long run it will be easier to debug things. For Sass, I only need to transform all the css because it's making weird bugs here and there. The overall code is much simpler than the previous project that only used React Javascript and plain css.
